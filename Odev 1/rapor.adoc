=== Pigeonhole principle :
 Pigeonhole principle is commonly used in mathematics. pigeonhole principle states thatif  n items are put into m containers, 
 with  n>m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.I am going to prove this principle 
 by applying one of the example and solve it by python program using conditional statements. 
The example to prove that more than one student can have the same alphabets if the number of student (n) is more than
the number of alphabets(n>m).

[WARNING]
====

Example:
Assume that we have n number of students inside the class , according to Pigeonhole principle,  prove that more than one student
have their  names started with the same alphabets?

====

[TIP]
====

There are n number of students(Pigeon) inside the class and there are 26 english alphabets(m) (pigeonholes).
 By applying Pigeonhole principle
1- If the number of students is less than or equal the number of alphabets( n<=m ),Pigeonhole principle can not be applied.
2- If the number of students is greater than the number of alphabets( n>m ),Pigeonhole principle can be applied. However
more than one student will have their names starting with the same alphabets.
